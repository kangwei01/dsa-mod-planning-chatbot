List all the Level 2000 core modules for the DSA major.,"Here is a list of Level 2000 core modules for the Data Science & Analytics (DSA) major:

1. **DSA2101**: Essential Data Analytics Tools: Data Visualisation
2. **DSA2102**: Essential Data Analytics Tools: Numerical Computation
3. **MA2001**: Linear Algebra I
4. **MA2002**: Calculus
5. **MA2311**: Techniques in Advanced Calculus
6. **MA2104**: Multivariable Calculus
7. **ST2131**: Probability
8. **ST2132**: Mathematical Statistics
9. **CS2040**: Data Structures and Algorithms (multiple variants: CS2040, CS2040C, CS2040DE, CS2040S)

These modules are typically part of the core curriculum for the DSA major at NUS. Let me know if you need further details about any of these modules!",138.2758695000084,"Must include: CS2040, DSA2101, DSA2102, MA2001, MA2002, MA2311, ST2131, ST2132; Total Units = 32 MCs.","Okay, let's evaluate the chatbot's response based on the given criteria.

First, looking at **Accuracy**. The ground truth lists CS2040, DSA2101, DSA2102, MA2001, MA2002, MA2311, ST2131, ST2132. The predicted answer includes all these except MA2104, which isn't in the ground truth. However, they included CS2040 with its variants, which might be acceptable if the ground truth considers all variants as part of the core. But the ground truth only lists CS2040, not the variants. Also, the predicted answer includes MA2104, which isn't in the ground truth. So there's an error here. The total units in the ground truth are 32 MCs, but the predicted answer doesn't mention units. So accuracy is partially correct but has some errors.

For **Relevance**, the response directly answers the question by listing the modules. Even though there are some inaccuracies, the answer is on point and addresses the user's need. So relevance is high.

**Coherence** is good. The response is well-structured, uses bullet points, and explains the modules clearly. The mention of variants for CS2040 is a bit extra but doesn't affect coherence. The language is clear and easy to understand.

So accuracy would be around 0.8 because most modules are correct except MA2104 and the variants. Relevance is 1.0 as it directly answers the question. Coherence is 1.0 as it's well-structured and clear.

What are the Level 3000 modules I need to take for DSA?,"The Level 3000 modules required for the Data Science and Analytics (DSA) major are as follows:

- **CS3244 Machine Learning**
- **DSA3101 Data Science in Practice**
- **DSA3102 Essential Data Analytics Tools: Convex Optimisation**
- **ST3131 Regression Analysis**

These modules are mandatory and contribute a total of 16 units toward the major. Let me know if you need further details about any of these modules!",64.1353138750128,"Must include: CS3244, DSA3101, DSA3102, ST3131; Total Units = 16 MCs.","Okay, let's evaluate the chatbot's response based on the given criteria.

First, **accuracy**: The ground truth lists CS3244, DSA3101, DSA3102, and ST3131 as required modules with a total of 16 MCs. The predicted answer includes all these modules correctly. The module titles are also accurately presented, like ""Data Science in Practice"" for DSA3101 and ""Regression Analysis"" for ST3131. The total units mentioned are correct. So accuracy seems to be 1.0.

Next, **relevance**: The question asks specifically about Level 3000 modules for DSA. The response lists exactly those modules and mentions they are mandatory for the DSA major. It directly answers the query without extra information. Relevance is also 1.0.

For **coherence**: The response is well-structured, using bullet points for clarity. The language is grammatically correct and easy to understand. The mention of total units and the offer to provide further details adds helpful context. Coherence is 1.0 as well.

So all three scores should be 1.0.

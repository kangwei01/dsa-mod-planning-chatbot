## Notes

### Footnotes

¹ DSA1101 will be read in fulfilment of the Data Literacy requirement under the College of Humanities and Sciences.

² CS1010S Programming Methodology, the pre-requisite of CS2040, will be read in fulfilment of the Digital Literacy requirement under the College of Humanities and Sciences.

\*DSA4288x can be double-counted (up to maximum of 8 Units) towards major and specialisation requirements.

### Note on CHS Common Curriculum Courses

**1) Course Timing:**
Students are strongly encouraged to complete all CHS Common Curriculum courses in their first two years except for the following 3 courses:
- **Communities and Engagement course** – can be taken from Years 2 to 4*
- **Two Interdisciplinary courses** – can be taken in Years 3 and 4

**Important note on workload: Semester vs. Year-long C&E courses**

- Some C&E courses, usually the field/project-work courses, are regular intense 4-Unit courses with work completed within one semester.
- Other C&E courses, especially the service-work courses, are spread out over two consecutive semesters, or up to one year, that is, Semester 1 through Semester 2 to Special Term 2; or Semester 2 through the Special Terms to Semester 1 of following Academic Year (AY). [More details on service-work courses](URL).
- For those students who read the year-long C&E courses which extend till Special Term (during the summer break) after their 8th semester, please note that grades are awarded at the end of Special Term 2, which means your degree will be conferred in end-Aug, and you will join the Commencement ceremony in the following year instead of the same AY of completion of the course. [Check FAQ for more details](URL).
- As such, students who prefer to take such year-long C&E courses instead of semester-long courses (where the latter might have limited capacity in each semester) are encouraged to plan in advance. You may do so by including the C&E course in your study plan earlier in your candidature; for example, during Year 2 of study.
- This would allow students to plan for other enrichment programmes (such as Student Exchange programmes, NOC and/or UPIP/Internships) during Year 3 instead of delaying this requirement to Year 4 when students will need to devote time for their job search in the final semester as they complete the remaining graduation requirements.
- For more enquiries, please check out the FAQ, or email the C&E team at AskCnE@nus.edu.sg.
